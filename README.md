<p>This is a project that has been done by Sean Ferons previously.
This project is designed to help deaf students with reading. 
They can point at a word and get the video of a person signing out the definition of the word.</p>

<p>Solve these problems:
<br>1. Speed up timing to look up words in dictionary</br>
<br>2. Increase the accuracy when cropping word </br>
<br>3. Play the Sign Language video(not sure if it's done or not, have not seen it working properly yet</br></p>
