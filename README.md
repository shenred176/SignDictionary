This is a project that has been done by Sean Ferons previously.
This project is designed to help deaf students with reading. 
They can point at a word and get the video of a person signing out the definition of the word.

Current Stage: Get the application to work on Android Mobile App.

Solve these problems:
1. Speed up timing to look up words in dictionary
2. Increase the accuracy when cropping word 
3. Play the Sign Language video(not sure if it's done or not, have not seen it working properly yet)
